## Install a recent version of R

`SpaDES` requires R version `3.2.2` or greater.

Download and install the latest version of R (3.3.2) from [https://cran.rstudio.com/](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

## Install the latest RStudio

![](images/RStudio-Logo-Blue-Gray-125.png)

Download and install the latest RStudio from [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download)

Developer preview versions are available from [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)

## Install `SpaDES`

Ensure you have updated the packages on your computer, installed the latest development version of the `SpaDES` package and its dependencies:

```{r install-SpaDES, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
## update your packages and install prerequisites
update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)
install.packages("devtools", "knitr", "profvis", "rmarkdown", "SpaDES",
                 dependencies = TRUE)

## install SpaDES to your default package library
## to install elsewhere use 'withr::with_libpaths()'
devtools::install_github("PredictiveEcology/SpaDES@development",
                         dependencies = TRUE)

# check package version
packageVersion("SpaDES") ## should be >= 1.3.1.9016
```

## Additional dependencies

**Important note:** Installing `SpaDES` will install a number of additional spatial packages, some of which have additional system dependencies not covered by simply installing the R package.

See [this post](http://predictiveecology.org/2015/04/24/installing-R-spatial-packages.html) on how to ensure you can install the system dependencies required to install these packages.

## Brainstorm your `SpaDES` needs

- Use a pre-existing module as is? Which one(s)?

- Modify a pre-exising module? Enhance it? Fix bugs?

- Are you going to make a new module?

- Add a new module to a group of other modules (*e.g.*, add fires to vegetation dynamics)?

- Learn some ecological modeling?

- Come with specific problems ...

## Data & Model

- Bring any data that you would like to work with
- If you have a conceptual model that you would like to work on, bring it

## Create a new RStudio project

1. From the *File* menu, select *New Project...*.
2. Select *New Directory*.
3. Select *Empty Project*.
4. Name your project and select where to save it.
5. Don't worry about 'Packrat' and 'Git repositories'. Leave these unchecked.
6. (Optional) You may want to open your project in a new Rstudio session.
7. As we go through the workshop, keep your code in an `.R` or `.Rmd` file.
