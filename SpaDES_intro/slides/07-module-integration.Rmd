## Building models from modules

A model (as defined in the SpaDES world) consists of multiple interacting components (sub-models), which in the vocabulary of `SpaDES` we have been referring to as 'modules'

- One could imagine an example model:

    - caribou movement
    - vegetation dynamics
    - disturbance dynamics
    - data cleaning, downloading etc.
    
- And we would give this ensemble of modules a name, like "LCC2005" (or maybe even a better name, but we will go with this)

## LCC2005

([Return to LCC2005 model](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES-modules/blob/master/modules/LCC2005/LCC2005.html))

- Run the first chunk to download the model
